    <h2>My Vacation in Alaska</h2>
    <p> A couple years ago, I went with my family on a vacation to Alaska.
        We went to a lot of places there. Out of all of them, the most memorable place
        is Denali National Park. Loved seeing the wildlife and the glaciers there.

    <h2>Accropolis</h2>
    <p>
        My favorite restaurant is Acropolis Pizza & Pasta - Kirkland. 
        I really like their Italian food, especially their oven baked meals. 
        Also, their Minstrone soup is nice too.
        <a href="https://www.acropolispizzapasta.com/" target="_blank">Visit the restaurant</a>.
